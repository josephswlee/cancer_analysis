This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

set.seed(1891)
library(readr)



cancer$diagnosis <- revalue(cancer$diagnosis, c("M"=1))
cancer$diagnosis <- revalue(cancer$diagnosis, c("B"=0))

cancer$diagnosis <- as.numeric(cancer$diagnosis) 

```



```{r}
table(cancer$diagnosis)

summary(cancer[c("radius_mean","smoothness_mean","compactness_mean")])

```

```{r}

library(corrplot)
library(corrr)
library(ggplot2)

cor1 <- cor(x = cancer$diagnosis, y = cancer[2:19], use="complete.obs")
corrplot(cor1, tl.srt = 25)

```



```{r}

radius_d <- density(cancer$radius_mean)

plot(radius_d)

smoothness_d <- density(cancer$smoothness_mean)

plot(smoothness_d)

compactness_d <- density(cancer$compactness_mean)

plot(compactness_d)


```



#feature scaling
```{r}
# normalization must occur given different scales, kNN is distance based, and metrics are not gaussian in dist.

normalize <- function(x) {
  return ((x- min(x))/ (max(x)- min(x)))
}

cancer_norm <- as.data.frame(lapply(cancer[2:19], normalize))

summary(cancer_norm$radius_mean)
# looks normalized

```

```{r}

# next comes training and model


```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
